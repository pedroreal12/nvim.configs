# nvim.configs
This repository holds all my config files and plugins for my neovim environment.

## Why am I using neovim?
I wanted to try out neovim as it is really customizable and flexible.
Also because I enjoy the idea of only using the keyboard, I'm not very much a mouse/touchpad user.

## What plugins are you using?
I am using some plugins so i can optimize some actions inside neovim just like:
- Packer as a package manager so I can install/uninstall plugins more easily
[Packer]([https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim))
- [Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim), [Mason-lspconfig](https://github.com/williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim), [Lsp-zero](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim), [Lsp-config](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) for Language Server Protocol (LSP) handling
- [Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) to optimize some Git commands inside my environment
- [Harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon) so I am able to travel faster inside my projects a lot faster
- [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) to find and search for files inside my projects
- [Treesitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) to highlight and parse code
- [Undotree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree) to keep a local history of the files i edit in case I don't add them to git or any other reason
- [Nvim-Tree](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua) to use as a tree viewer
- [Rose-pine](https://github.com/rose-pine/neovim) by now I am using rose-pine as a theme in neovim
