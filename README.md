# nvim.configs
This repository holds all my config files and plugins for my neovim environment.

## Why am I using neovim?
I wanted to try out neovim as it is really customizable and flexible.
Also because I enjoy the idea of only using the keyboard, I'm not very much a mouse/touchpad enjoyer.

## What plugins are you using?
I am using some plugins so i can optimize some of my activities inside neovim just like:

- [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) as a package manager so I can install/uninstall plugins easily
- Lsp plugins for Language Server Protocol (LSP) handling:
    - [Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim)
    - [Mason-lspconfig](https://github.com/williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim)
    - [Lsp-zero](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim)
    - [Lsp-config](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) 

- [Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) to optimize some Git commands inside neovim 

- [Harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon) so I am able to travel faster inside my projects

- [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) to find and search for files inside my projects

- [Treesitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) to highlight and parse code

- [Undotree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree) to keep a local history of the files I'm working on in case I don't add them to git or any other reason

- [Nvim-Tree](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua) to use as a tree viewer

- [Rose-pine](https://github.com/rose-pine/neovim) by now I am using rose-pine as a theme in neovim

- [Glow.nvim](https://github.com/ellisonleao/glow.nvim) integrates Glow and neovim to preview markdown files inside neovim
    - [Glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow) Glow.nvim requires Glow wich is a TUI application to preview markdown files
